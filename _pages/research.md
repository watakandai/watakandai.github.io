## [Action acquisition using Bayesian optimization](../_research/bopt_dmp.md)
![bopt_dmp](../images/bopt_dmp.gif)
Make the robot learn a motion in small number of iterations (30 iterations)

## [Suppression of Virtual Reality Sickness on Drone](../_research/vrsickness.md)
**[Head-synced Drone Control for Reducing Virtual Reality Sickness](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10846-019-01054-6)**

Developed a drone controller that aims to suppress the movement that may induce the virtual reality sickness.


## [Image Recognition of an Eggplant for Manipulation Task](../_research/eggplant_yolov3.md)
![eggplant_yolov3_demo](../images/eggplant_yolov3_demo.png)

Implemented a convolutional neural network to detect an eggplant.
Implemented on ROS. It can detect an object, get the depth information and the likelihood of the object.


## [Simulation of Inverted Pendulum using a simple Neural Network](../_research/sim_pendulum.md)

[![sim_pendulum](../images/sim_pendulum_incase.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7sOc22s1KA)

The neural network was used to decide on when to transition from the unstabilized controller to the stabilized controller.
