Objective
----------
- Propose a framework for learning task specifications from demonstrations and planning with safety guarantees
- Learn specifications as automata and preferences as probabilities
- Embed safety constraints in the learning process, which improves learning and mitigates reliance on hyper-parameter tunning
- Introduce planning algorithm for the most preferred plan that achieves the learned task
