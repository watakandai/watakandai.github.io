I am a 1st year Ph.D student in [Human Interaction Robotics (HIRO) Group](https://hiro-group.ronc.one) at [University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/).

## Previous Work

At Takahashi lab, my research was to design and build a controller for a drone so that people do no get virtual reality sickness when they control it in first-person view (FPV). You can check the paper [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10846-019-01054-6).
My strength is the ability to build end-to-end systems from hardware to software (also including human in the loop).

## Interests

My research is on motion learning and task learning for robots.
Especially, I am interested in the intersection between Control Theory and Reinforcement Learning.
In other words, intersection between classic model-based control and computer science approach.

## Bio

I completed my Bachelor and Master at [Keio University](https://www.keio.ac.jp/) in Japan, under the supervision of [Masaki Takahashi](http://www.yt.sd.keio.ac.jp).
I also studied at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champain for a year. Majored in Aerospace Engineering and Computer Science.
